# Time Analyzer

TimeAnalyzer is an AngularJs applicaztion to evaluate the time tracked with Caato TimeTracker

## Installation

The application is generated and developed with GruntJs so:
- clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/matteoscandolo/timeAnalyzer.git`
- install grunt packages with `npm install`
- install js dependencies with `bower install`

## Getting Started

To use this version, replace `app/files/data.csv` with your own `.csv` file exported from Caato. Then you can run the app via `grunt serve` or (probabily but not tested) build the application with `grunt build`. This will output the code in the `dist` folder.

## TODO

- Document the `main.js` controller
- Install `grunt-docco` to generate the documentation
- Dinamically load a file via the Browser FileAPI
- Improve the Layout

If you use this app, please quote me.

Thanks
